- do not ramp up fan so hard (smoothen it out)
- device should have own topic prefix (like /ceilingfan-12345678/online -> true)
- there should be possibility to set max fan speed via MQTT and save that into the EEPROM becuase there might be power supplies used that do not give enough current
- random generate device ID and save it to EEPROM
